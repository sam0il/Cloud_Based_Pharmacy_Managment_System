**Date:** 21 February 2026  
Initial version of the project charter.

## 4. THE PURPOSE AND THE OBJECTIVES OF THE PROJECT

### Purpose

The purpose of the project is to ensure that patient prescriptions are always available digitally, regardless of which hospital or pharmacy they visit. The system will also reduce paperwork, make it faster and easier for patients to receive their prescriptions and medication and improve system safety and alerts.

## 5. THE IMPORTANCE OF THE PROJECT FOR THE ORGANIZATION AND ITS ENVIRONMENT

The Cloud-Based Pharmacy Management System is important because it replaces outdated and disconnected pharmacy software with one centralized platform. This will improve inventory tracking, prescription processing and sales management, reducing errors and saving time. The system will also increase data security through controlled access, secure storage and backups and help the pharmacy meet healthcare regulations. In addition, it will improve customer service and patient safety by enabling faster prescription handling and better cooperation with doctors and healthcare systems. Overall, the project improves efficiency, security and quality of pharmacy services.

### Objectives

- Allow pharmacists to search patients, view medical records and manage medication inventory.  
- Automatically update stock levels after each sale or prescription.  
- Send alerts when medicines are running low or nearing expiry.  
- Support the digital processing of electronic prescriptions by doctors.  
- Automatically link prescriptions to the patient’s medical record.  
- Provide clear reports about sales, stock status and suppliers.  
- Enable synchronization between different pharmacy branches.  
- Allow doctors to add, search and manage patient records.  
- Allow the admin to manage different roles in the system.  
- Ensure that all data is stored securely and regularly backed up.  
- The system should support real-time data access across all pharmacy branches.  
- The system should support role-based access control for Doctor, Pharmacist and Admin.

## 6. POSSIBLE REQUIREMENTS OF THE CONTRACTING AUTHORITY

### TECHNIQUES AND TECHNOLOGIES USED

Possible technologies that we will use:

- Backend: Node.js / similar framework  
- Frontend: React, HTML, CSS, JavaScript  
- Database: MySQL / PostgreSQL / Google Cloud SQL  
- Version control: GitHub  

### SPATIAL AND WORKING CONDITIONS

Weekly meetings at the faculty and home contributions.

### DESCRIPTION OF THE FINISHED PRODUCT, SERVICE OR RESULT

The Cloud-Based Pharmacy Management System will support three user roles: Pharmacist, Doctor and Admin, each of them with secure login access. Pharmacists will be able to check medicine availability and expiry dates, search patients, view prescriptions, complete prescriptions and receive alerts for low or expiring stock. Doctors will be able to manage patient records and issue or update electronic prescriptions, which will become immediately available to pharmacists. Administrators will manage inventory, control user roles and permissions, generate reports on sales and stock and synchronize data across all pharmacy branches to keep information accurate and up to date.

### REPORTING AND FINAL REPORT

Progress will be monitored through repository commits on GitHub.

## 7. PROJECT LIMITATIONS

Integration with national e-prescription systems and doctors' portals may need approvals and changes which are not in the team’s control.
 Synchronization must be stable even when a branch is offline
 For data privacy and controlled access, role-based access control and auditability are required

###  ROUGH SCHEDULE

* Requirements analysis: March 2026
* System design: March–April 2026
* Implementation: April–May 2026
* Testing and documentation: June 2026

###  AVAILABLE FUNDS
We assumed that the required funding has been secured which means the project can use the needed cloud services, security tooling and testing resources. The budget is allocated to ensure stable infrastructure, reliable backups, realistic testing and coverage for integration or migration needs.


###  MILESTONES - DATES REQUIRED

* Approved requirements: 28 March 2026
* Prototype ready: 24 April 2026
* Feature-complete system: 29 May 2026
* Final version submitted: 30 June 2026

## 9. RISK ASSESSMENT
The highest risk, beside the standard software delivery risks regarding scope, time and integration, is moving the stakeholder’s existing data into the new centralized system, such as patient records, prescriptions, inventory and suppliers, because the data may be inconsistent, incomplete or missing. 
* Data migration
* Changing requirements
* Frontend–backend + external integrations
* Security + performance
