## 4. THE IMPORTANCE OF THE PROJECT FOR THE ORGANIZATION AND ITS ENVIRONMENT

The Cloud-Based Pharmacy Management System is important because it replaces outdated and disconnected pharmacy software with one centralized platform. This will improve inventory tracking, prescription processing and sales management, reducing errors and saving time. The system will also increase data security through controlled access, secure storage and backups and help the pharmacy meet healthcare regulations. In addition, it will improve customer service and patient safety by enabling faster prescription handling and better cooperation with doctors and healthcare systems. Overall, the project improves efficiency, security and quality of pharmacy services.

## 5. THE PURPOSE AND THE OBJECTIVES OF THE PROJECT

### Purpose

The purpose of the project is to ensure that patient prescriptions are always available digitally, regardless of which hospital or pharmacy they visit. The system will also reduce paperwork, make it faster and easier for patients to receive their prescriptions and medication, and improve system safety and alerts.

### Objectives

- Allow pharmacists to search patients, view medical records and manage medication inventory.  
- Automatically update stock levels after each sale or prescription.  
- Send alerts when medicines are running low or nearing expiry.  
- Support the digital processing of electronic prescriptions by doctors.  
- Automatically link prescriptions to the patient’s medical record.  
- Provide clear reports about sales, stock status, and suppliers.  
- Enable synchronization between different pharmacy branches.  
- Allow doctors to add, search and manage patient records.  
- Allow the admin to manage different roles in the system.  
- Ensure that all data is stored securely and regularly backed up.  
- The system should support real-time data access across all pharmacy branches.  
- The system should support role-based access control for Doctor, Pharmacist, and Admin users.

## 6. POSSIBLE REQUIREMENTS OF THE CONTRACTING AUTHORITY

### TECHNIQUES AND TECHNOLOGIES USED

Possible technologies that we will use:

- Backend: Node.js / similar framework

### DESCRIPTION OF THE FINISHED PRODUCT, SERVICE OR RESULT

The Cloud-Based Pharmacy Management System will support three user roles: Pharmacist, Doctor and Admin, each of them with secure login access. Pharmacists will be able to check medicine availability and expiry dates, search patients, view prescriptions, complete prescriptions and receive alerts for low or expiring stock. Doctors will be able to manage patient records and issue or update electronic prescriptions, which will become immediately available to pharmacists. Administrators will manage inventory, control user roles and permissions, generate reports on sales and stock and synchronize data across all pharmacy branches to keep information accurate and up to date.

### REPORTING AND FINAL REPORT

Progress will be monitored through repository commits on GitHub.
